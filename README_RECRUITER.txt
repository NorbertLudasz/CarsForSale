Throughout this project I constructed a website that deals with advertisements of cars for sale.
On the homepage you can see a listing of all available cars for sale alongside basic information about each of them: 
the brand, city it's in, its price and an option to view more details.

You may also filter what listings you see based on parameters of your choice.

The page with detailed information about each advertisement also contains the listing's date of posting as well as any images attached to it, 
with an option to upload new ones or delete existing ones as well.

Lastly, there is the "Sell your car" page in which you can fill out a form to add your own advertisement to the listing. 
You may go from any page back to the home page.

This project uses a local database to create the listing of advertisements, therefore I included screenshots of what various pages look like in the presentationImages folder as well. 
Please do check them out.
Thank you for your time.
